## 3 CS Conference

NIPS: Contains a big area in Computer Science

KDD: Focus on big data

CVPR: Focus on computer vision

As the gif shows, Those 3 don't have much connection in early years. 

As machine learning becomes a big topic in academia, NIPS have more connection with other 2 conference. CVPR and KDD don't much overlapped area because they focus on different area.
