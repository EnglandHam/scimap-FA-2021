Female_gender

A paper can have many authors. We use white color for male (since the background color is white, we cannot see all the male paper) and red for female.

We also use different transparency for different paper. For example, if a paper's arthor are all female, the red is 100% red. If the paper's author are 2 males and females, the red is 50% red.
